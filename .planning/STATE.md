# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-31)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Project Level]: Recharts for visualizations (already chosen, declarative API, good for time-series)
- [Project Level]: Separate Analytics page/tab (keep analytics accessible but not clutter main dashboard)
- [Project Level]: Usage cards first, then charts (progressive enhancement, core metrics before visualization)
- [Project Level]: Cache analytics data 5-15 min (reduce API load, analytics not real-time critical)

**Phase 1 Decisions:**
- [01-01]: Analytics positioned as second tab after Dashboard for high visibility
- [01-01]: Time range presets (7/30/90 days) with immediate state change on selection
- [01-01]: CSV export filename includes preset and date for easy identification
- [01-01]: Loading overlay with backdrop blur during time range changes
- [01-01]: Touch-manipulation CSS class for mobile optimization
- [01-01]: Role-based access: ADMIN and FOREMAN only, DRIVER excluded

**Phase 2 Decisions:**
- [02-01]: Infinity symbol (&infin;) with 60% opacity for unlimited resources (limit === -1)
- [02-01]: Color coding: emerald < 70%, amber 70-90%, red > 90%
- [02-01]: Pulse animation only on red progress bars (>90% utilization) for emphasis
- [02-01]: Progress bar transition: 500ms ease-out for smooth animations
- [02-01]: ARIA accessibility attributes on progress bars (role, aria-valuenow, aria-valuemin, aria-valuemax)
- [02-01]: Loading skeletons with pulse animation for better perceived performance

**Phase 3 Decisions:**
- [03-01]: Bar chart with sharp corners (industrial aesthetic, cleaner than rounded)
- [03-01]: Tab bar control above chart, full-width stretch (modern, touch-friendly)
- [03-01]: Short date format on x-axis: "15 янв" (compact, auto-scaled by Recharts)
- [03-01]: K suffix on y-axis: "15K", "2.5K" (common analytics pattern)
- [03-01]: Smart precision: no decimals for counts/hours, formatted for salary
- [03-01]: Horizontal grid lines (dashed slate-200) for easier value reading
- [03-01]: 300ms animation duration on metric/time range changes
- [03-01]: Indigo color palette: indigo-600 (shifts), indigo-700 (hours), indigo-800 (salary)
